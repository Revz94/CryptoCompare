# CryptoCompare


This project involved analyzing historical cryptocurrency price data using the CryptoCompare API. The goal was to identify trends, correlations, and patterns that could inform investment decisions. The project began by choosing a cryptocurrency and gathering its historical price data. The data was then cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or irrelevant information. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the characteristics of the data, and correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between the chosen cryptocurrency and other variables. Time-series analysis techniques were used to forecast future prices, and sentiment analysis was conducted to understand how public sentiment affects cryptocurrency prices. Finally, a simple trading strategy was implemented and backtested using historical data, and the project concluded with a summary of findings and insights gained from the analysis.
